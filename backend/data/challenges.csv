2026-02-03,Linear Systems,Medium,Apply,Systems of Linear Equations: What are the main methods for solving systems?,79,"The main methods for solving systems of linear equations are: 1) Substitution Method - solve one equation for a variable and substitute into the other equations; 2) Elimination Method (Addition/Subtraction) - add or subtract equations to eliminate variables; 3) Matrix Method - use row reduction (Gaussian elimination) on the augmented matrix to reach row echelon form or reduced row echelon form; 4) Cramer's Rule - use determinants to find solutions (only works when the coefficient matrix is square and non-singular); 5) Graphical Method - plot equations and find intersection points (practical for 2-3 variables). The choice depends on system size and structure. For large systems, matrix methods are most efficient. Systems can have one solution (consistent independent), infinitely many solutions (consistent dependent), or no solution (inconsistent)."
2026-02-02,Trigonometry,Medium,Analyze,Solving Trigonometric Equations: How do you find all solutions to trigonometric equations?,72,"To find all solutions to trigonometric equations: 1) Isolate the trigonometric function (e.g., sin(x) = k); 2) Find the principal solution(s) using inverse trig functions; 3) Use periodicity to find all solutions - for sin and cos add 2πn, for tan add πn where n is any integer; 4) Check for additional solutions within one period using reference angles and quadrant analysis; 5) Apply domain restrictions if specified. Key strategies: a) Use trig identities (Pythagorean, double angle, sum/difference) to simplify; b) Factor when possible; c) For equations like sin(2x) = k, substitute u = 2x first, then adjust the general solution; d) Verify solutions don't create undefined expressions. Example: sin(x) = 1/2 has solutions x = π/6 + 2πn and x = 5π/6 + 2πn for integer n."
2026-02-01,Algebra,Easy,Remember,Laws of Exponents: How do you apply exponent rules to simplify expressions?,92,"The fundamental laws of exponents are: 1) Product Rule: a^m · a^n = a^(m+n); 2) Quotient Rule: a^m / a^n = a^(m-n); 3) Power Rule: (a^m)^n = a^(mn); 4) Power of Product: (ab)^n = a^n · b^n; 5) Power of Quotient: (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n; 6) Zero Exponent: a^0 = 1 (a ≠ 0); 7) Negative Exponent: a^(-n) = 1/a^n; 8) Fractional Exponent: a^(m/n) = ⁿ√(a^m) = (ⁿ√a)^m. To simplify: combine like bases using product/quotient rules, eliminate negative exponents by moving factors between numerator and denominator, convert roots to fractional exponents when helpful, and simplify numerical coefficients separately from variable expressions."
2026-01-31,Calculus,Medium,Understand,Continuity and Differentiability: What's the relationship between these concepts?,81,"Continuity and differentiability are related but distinct concepts. A function f is continuous at x = a if: 1) f(a) exists, 2) lim(x→a) f(x) exists, and 3) lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a). A function is differentiable at x = a if f'(a) = lim(h→0) [f(a+h) - f(a)]/h exists. Key relationship: Differentiability implies continuity, but continuity does NOT imply differentiability. If f is differentiable at a, it must be continuous there (proof: lim(x→a) f(x) = lim(x→a) [f(x) - f(a) + f(a)] = lim(x→a) [(f(x) - f(a))/(x-a)]·(x-a) + f(a) = f'(a)·0 + f(a) = f(a)). However, continuous functions may have corners, cusps, or vertical tangents where they're not differentiable. Classic example: f(x) = |x| is continuous at x = 0 but not differentiable there (sharp corner). For a function to be differentiable, it must be smooth without breaks, jumps, corners, or vertical tangent lines."
2026-01-30,Discrete Math,Medium,Apply,Combinations and Permutations: When do you use each and how do you calculate them?,78,"Permutations are used when ORDER MATTERS; combinations when order doesn't matter. Permutations: P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)! represents arranging r objects from n distinct objects. Use for: passwords, race rankings, seating arrangements. Example: arranging 3 people from 5 = P(5,3) = 5!/2! = 60. Combinations: C(n,r) = n!/[r!(n-r)!] represents selecting r objects from n when order is irrelevant. Use for: lottery numbers, committee selection, choosing items. Example: selecting 3 people from 5 = C(5,3) = 5!/(3!2!) = 10. Key differences: C(n,r) ≤ P(n,r) always, and C(n,r) = P(n,r)/r!. Special cases: C(n,0) = 1, C(n,n) = 1, C(n,1) = n. With repetition: permutations become n^r; combinations use stars and bars: C(n+r-1, r). Circular permutations: (n-1)!/2 for necklaces (rotation and reflection)."
2026-01-29,Analysis,Hard,Analyze,Mean Value Theorem: What does MVT state and what are its implications?,62,"The Mean Value Theorem states: If f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) where f'(c) = [f(b) - f(a)]/(b - a). Geometric interpretation: there's at least one point where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line connecting endpoints. Implications: 1) If f'(x) = 0 for all x in (a,b), then f is constant on [a,b]; 2) If f'(x) = g'(x) for all x in (a,b), then f(x) = g(x) + C for some constant C; 3) If f'(x) > 0 on (a,b), then f is strictly increasing on [a,b]; if f'(x) < 0, then f is strictly decreasing. MVT is fundamental for proving monotonicity, bounding functions, error estimates in Taylor series, and L'Hôpital's rule. Rolle's Theorem is a special case where f(a) = f(b), guaranteeing f'(c) = 0. MVT requires both continuity on closed interval and differentiability on open interval."
2026-01-28,Sequences,Medium,Understand,Convergence of Sequences: When does a sequence converge and how do you find limits?,69,"A sequence {a_n} converges to L if for every ε > 0, there exists N such that |a_n - L| < ε for all n > N. Tests for convergence: 1) Direct limit calculation: compute lim(n→∞) a_n using algebra, L'Hôpital's rule for indeterminate forms; 2) Squeeze Theorem: if b_n ≤ a_n ≤ c_n and lim b_n = lim c_n = L, then lim a_n = L; 3) Monotone Convergence Theorem: bounded monotonic sequences converge; 4) Ratio test, root test for geometric-like sequences. Common techniques: factor out highest power in rational expressions, use standard limits (lim(1 + 1/n)^n = e, lim sin(n)/n = 0), recognize geometric sequences (r^n converges to 0 if |r| < 1). Divergence indicators: oscillation, unbounded growth, limit doesn't exist. Cauchy criterion: {a_n} converges iff for every ε > 0, exists N where |a_m - a_n| < ε for all m,n > N."
2026-01-27,Calculus,Hard,Apply,Improper Integrals: How do you evaluate integrals with infinite limits or discontinuities?,57,"Improper integrals handle infinite intervals or discontinuous integrands. Type I (infinite limits): ∫[a,∞) f(x)dx = lim(t→∞) ∫[a,t] f(x)dx; ∫(-∞,b] f(x)dx = lim(t→-∞) ∫[t,b] f(x)dx; ∫(-∞,∞) f(x)dx = ∫(-∞,c] + ∫[c,∞) (split at any c). Type II (discontinuity at point c): If f has discontinuity at a: ∫[a,b] = lim(t→a+) ∫[t,b]; at b: ∫[a,b] = lim(t→b-) ∫[a,t]; interior point c: split at c and take both limits. Convergence tests: 1) Direct evaluation - compute the limit; 2) Comparison test: if 0 ≤ f(x) ≤ g(x) and ∫g converges, then ∫f converges; 3) Limit comparison test; 4) p-test: ∫[1,∞) 1/x^p dx converges iff p > 1. Common: ∫[0,∞) e^(-x)dx = 1, ∫[1,∞) 1/x dx diverges. If any limit doesn't exist or is ±∞, the integral diverges."
2026-01-26,Linear Algebra,Medium,Understand,Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: What do they represent and how are they found?,65,"For square matrix A, eigenvalue λ and eigenvector v satisfy Av = λv (v ≠ 0). Geometric meaning: eigenvectors are directions that remain unchanged under transformation A (only scaled by λ). To find: 1) Solve characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0 to find eigenvalues; 2) For each λ, solve (A - λI)v = 0 to find corresponding eigenvectors. Example: A = [[3,1],[0,2]] → det([[3-λ,1],[0,2-λ]]) = (3-λ)(2-λ) = 0 → λ₁=3, λ₂=2. For λ=3: [[0,1],[0,-1]]v=0 → v₁=[1,0]ᵀ. Properties: 1) Eigenvalues of triangular matrix are diagonal entries; 2) tr(A) = Σλᵢ, det(A) = Πλᵢ; 3) A is invertible iff no eigenvalue is 0. Applications: diagonalization (A = PDP⁻¹), solving differential equations, principal component analysis, Google PageRank, stability analysis. Multiplicity: algebraic (in characteristic polynomial) vs geometric (dimension of eigenspace)."
2026-01-25,Statistics,Easy,Remember,Probability Distributions: Which distributions apply to which situations?,84,"Key probability distributions: 1) Binomial B(n,p): fixed trials n, success probability p, counting successes (coin flips, quality control); 2) Poisson Po(λ): rare events over interval, rate λ (emails per hour, defects per area); 3) Geometric Geo(p): trials until first success (rolls until six); 4) Uniform U(a,b): all outcomes equally likely over [a,b]; 5) Normal/Gaussian N(μ,σ²): continuous bell curve, many natural phenomena (heights, measurement errors), Central Limit Theorem; 6) Exponential Exp(λ): continuous waiting time for Poisson event (time between arrivals); 7) Hypergeometric: sampling without replacement (drawing cards); 8) Negative Binomial: trials until r successes. Discrete vs continuous: use PMF (probability mass function) vs PDF (probability density function). Normal approximation: use when np > 5 and n(1-p) > 5 for binomial. Standard normal Z ~ N(0,1) with Z-scores for probability lookup."
2026-01-24,Functions,Medium,Apply,"Asymptotes: How do you find vertical, horizontal, and oblique asymptotes?",77,"Vertical asymptotes (VA): occur at x = a where f(x) → ±∞. Find by: 1) Factor and simplify f(x); 2) Find where denominator = 0 but numerator ≠ 0; 3) Check limit behavior lim(x→a±) f(x). Example: f(x) = 1/(x-2) has VA at x = 2. Holes vs VA: if both numerator and denominator equal 0, it's a hole, not VA. Horizontal asymptotes (HA): y = L if lim(x→±∞) f(x) = L. For rational f(x) = P(x)/Q(x): compare degrees - if deg(P) < deg(Q): HA is y = 0; if deg(P) = deg(Q): HA is y = (leading coefficient of P)/(leading coefficient of Q); if deg(P) > deg(Q): no HA (check for oblique). Oblique/Slant asymptotes: when deg(P) = deg(Q) + 1, use polynomial long division: f(x) = mx + b + remainder/Q(x), then y = mx + b is oblique asymptote. Can't have both HA and oblique asymptote. Verify by checking lim(x→±∞) [f(x) - (mx+b)] = 0."
2026-01-23,Discrete Math,Easy,Remember,Boolean Algebra: What are the fundamental operations and properties?,86,"Boolean algebra operates on binary values {0,1} or {False,True}. Fundamental operations: 1) AND (∧, ·): 1·1=1, else 0; 2) OR (∨, +): 0+0=0, else 1; 3) NOT (¬, '): inverts value. Laws: Commutative: A∧B = B∧A, A∨B = B∨A; Associative: (A∧B)∧C = A∧(B∧C); Distributive: A∧(B∨C) = (A∧B)∨(A∧C); Identity: A∧1 = A, A∨0 = A; Null: A∧0 = 0, A∨1 = 1; Idempotent: A∧A = A, A∨A = A; Complement: A∧A' = 0, A∨A' = 1, (A')' = A; De Morgan's: (A∧B)' = A'∨B', (A∨B)' = A'∧B'; Absorption: A∨(A∧B) = A. Applications: digital logic circuits, set theory, logical reasoning. XOR (⊕): A⊕B = (A∧B')∨(A'∧B), equals 1 when inputs differ. NAND and NOR are functionally complete (can create any Boolean function)."
2026-01-22,Calculus,Medium,Analyze,Concavity and Inflection Points: How do you analyze these properties?,74,"Concavity describes how a curve bends. f is concave up on interval I if f''(x) > 0 for all x in I (curve opens upward, tangent lines below curve); concave down if f''(x) < 0 (opens downward, tangent lines above). Inflection point: where concavity changes, occurs at x = c where f''(c) = 0 or f'' undefined, AND f'' changes sign across c. Analysis procedure: 1) Find f''(x); 2) Solve f''(x) = 0 and find where f'' is undefined; 3) Test intervals between these points to determine sign of f''; 4) Inflection point at x = c only if f'' changes sign there. Note: f''(c) = 0 is necessary but not sufficient (counterexample: f(x) = x⁴ at x = 0, f''(0) = 0 but no inflection point). Second derivative test for extrema: if f'(c) = 0, then f''(c) > 0 implies local min, f''(c) < 0 implies local max. Physical interpretation: concavity relates to acceleration; inflection points mark transition in rate of change."
2026-01-21,Algebra,Medium,Understand,Rational Functions: What are their properties and how do you graph them?,76,"Rational function: f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) where P, Q are polynomials with Q(x) ≠ 0. Key properties: 1) Domain: all x except where Q(x) = 0; 2) Vertical asymptotes at zeros of Q(x) that aren't canceled by P(x); 3) Holes at x = a if (x-a) is factor of both P and Q; 4) Horizontal asymptote based on degree comparison (see asymptote rules); 5) x-intercepts where P(x) = 0 (and Q(x) ≠ 0); 6) y-intercept at f(0) if defined. Graphing steps: 1) Factor P and Q completely; 2) Find and mark domain restrictions; 3) Identify and draw asymptotes; 4) Find intercepts; 5) Determine behavior near asymptotes using test points and limits; 6) Analyze sign of f in each interval; 7) Plot key points and sketch smooth curves. End behavior follows asymptotes. Rational functions can cross horizontal asymptotes (but not vertical). For y = 1/(x-h)² + k, transformation of basic f(x) = 1/x²."
2026-01-20,Trigonometry,Easy,Remember,"Inverse Trigonometric Functions: What are their domains, ranges, and uses?",89,"Inverse trig functions reverse trig functions with restricted domains. 1) arcsin (sin⁻¹): Domain [-1,1], Range [-π/2, π/2], gives angle whose sine is x; 2) arccos (cos⁻¹): Domain [-1,1], Range [0,π]; 3) arctan (tan⁻¹): Domain (-∞,∞), Range (-π/2, π/2); 4) arccsc, arcsec, arccot: reciprocal inverses with corresponding restrictions. Key identities: sin(arcsin(x)) = x for |x| ≤ 1; arcsin(sin(x)) = x for x ∈ [-π/2, π/2]; sin(arccos(x)) = √(1-x²); tan(arcsin(x)) = x/√(1-x²). Uses: 1) Solving trig equations; 2) Integration (∫ 1/√(1-x²) dx = arcsin(x) + C); 3) Finding angles from ratios in triangles; 4) Calculus derivatives: d/dx[arcsin(x)] = 1/√(1-x²), d/dx[arctan(x)] = 1/(1+x²). Range restrictions ensure inverse functions are well-defined (functions must be one-to-one)."
2026-01-19,Linear Algebra,Hard,Analyze,Vector Spaces and Subspaces: What defines them and how do you verify properties?,58,"A vector space V over field F is a set with addition and scalar multiplication satisfying 10 axioms: closure under both operations, commutativity and associativity of addition, additive identity (zero vector), additive inverses, multiplicative identity (1·v = v), distributivity (both types), associativity of scalar multiplication. Standard examples: ℝⁿ, polynomials P_n, matrices M_{m×n}, functions C[a,b]. A subspace W ⊆ V must satisfy: 1) 0 ∈ W (contains zero vector); 2) Closure under addition: u,v ∈ W ⟹ u+v ∈ W; 3) Closure under scalar multiplication: v ∈ W, c ∈ F ⟹ cv ∈ W. Equivalently: W is subspace iff for all u,v ∈ W and scalars a,b, au+bv ∈ W. Verification example: W = {(x,y,z) : x+y+z = 0} in ℝ³: (0,0,0) ✓, sum of solutions is solution ✓, scalar multiple is solution ✓, so W is subspace (a plane through origin). Non-example: x+y+z = 1 fails (doesn't contain origin). Important subspaces: null space, column space, row space."
2026-01-18,Calculus,Easy,Apply,Derivatives of Exponential Functions: How do you differentiate exponential functions?,91,"Exponential function derivatives: 1) d/dx[e^x] = e^x (natural exponential is its own derivative); 2) d/dx[a^x] = a^x · ln(a) for base a > 0; 3) Chain rule for compositions: d/dx[e^{g(x)}] = e^{g(x)} · g'(x); d/dx[a^{g(x)}] = a^{g(x)} · ln(a) · g'(x). Examples: d/dx[e^{x²}] = e^{x²} · 2x; d/dx[2^{3x}] = 2^{3x} · ln(2) · 3 = 3ln(2) · 2^{3x}; d/dx[e^{sin(x)}] = e^{sin(x)} · cos(x). Key property: exponential growth rate proportional to current value (differential equation y' = ky has solution y = Ce^{kt}). For y = e^x, tangent line at (a, e^a) is y - e^a = e^a(x - a), slope equals function value. Integral: ∫e^x dx = e^x + C; ∫a^x dx = a^x/ln(a) + C. ln is inverse: d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x, ∫1/x dx = ln|x| + C."
2026-01-17,Statistics,Medium,Understand,Hypothesis Testing: What are the key steps and how do you interpret p-values?,71,"Hypothesis testing steps: 1) State hypotheses: H₀ (null, status quo) and H₁/Hₐ (alternative, claim to test); 2) Choose significance level α (commonly 0.05, probability of Type I error); 3) Calculate test statistic from sample data (z, t, χ², F depending on test); 4) Find p-value: probability of observing test statistic as extreme or more, assuming H₀ true; 5) Decision: reject H₀ if p-value < α, fail to reject if p-value ≥ α; 6) Conclusion in context. P-value interpretation: smaller p-value = stronger evidence against H₀. p < 0.01: very strong evidence; p < 0.05: strong evidence; p < 0.10: moderate evidence; p > 0.10: little/no evidence. Errors: Type I (false positive, reject true H₀, probability = α); Type II (false negative, fail to reject false H₀, probability = β). Power = 1-β (probability of correctly rejecting false H₀). One-tailed vs two-tailed tests depend on H₁. Important: failing to reject ≠ accepting H₀; statistical significance ≠ practical significance."
2026-01-16,Calculus,Medium,Apply,Logarithmic Differentiation: When is it useful and how do you apply it?,68,"Logarithmic differentiation is useful for: 1) Products/quotients of many functions; 2) Functions with variable bases and exponents f(x)^{g(x)}; 3) Complicated expressions where quotient/product rules are tedious. Procedure: 1) Take ln of both sides: ln(y) = ln(f(x)); 2) Simplify using log properties: ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b), ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b), ln(a^b) = b·ln(a); 3) Differentiate both sides (implicit differentiation): (1/y)·dy/dx = d/dx[ln(f(x))]; 4) Solve for dy/dx: dy/dx = y · d/dx[ln(f(x))] = f(x) · d/dx[ln(f(x))]. Example: y = x^x → ln(y) = x·ln(x) → (1/y)·y' = ln(x) + 1 → y' = x^x(ln(x) + 1). Another: y = (x²+1)^x → ln(y) = x·ln(x²+1) → y'/y = ln(x²+1) + x·2x/(x²+1) → y' = (x²+1)^x[ln(x²+1) + 2x²/(x²+1)]. More efficient than repeated chain/product rule. Works only when f(x) > 0 (ln defined)."
2026-01-15,Discrete Math,Medium,Understand,"Graph Theory Basics: What are vertices, edges, paths, and graph types?",75,"Graph G = (V,E): V is set of vertices (nodes), E is set of edges (connections). Edge connects two vertices. Types: 1) Undirected: edges have no direction {u,v}; Directed (digraph): edges have direction (u,v) ≠ (v,u); 2) Weighted: edges have numerical values; Unweighted: all edges equal; 3) Simple: no loops (edge from vertex to itself) or multiple edges; Multigraph: allows multiple edges between vertices; 4) Connected: path exists between any two vertices; Disconnected: some vertices unreachable; 5) Complete K_n: every vertex connected to every other; 6) Bipartite: vertices dividable into two sets, edges only between sets; 7) Tree: connected acyclic graph; Forest: disjoint trees. Path: sequence of vertices where consecutive vertices connected by edges, simple if no repeated vertices. Cycle: path starting and ending at same vertex. Degree: number of edges incident to vertex; sum of all degrees = 2|E|. Applications: social networks, routing, scheduling, computer networks."
2026-01-14,Algebra,Easy,Remember,Radicals and Rational Exponents: How do you simplify radical expressions?,87,"Radical notation: ⁿ√a is the nth root of a, where (ⁿ√a)ⁿ = a. Relationship to exponents: ⁿ√a = a^{1/n}, ⁿ√(a^m) = a^{m/n}. Simplification rules: 1) ⁿ√(ab) = ⁿ√a · ⁿ√b (product rule); 2) ⁿ√(a/b) = ⁿ√a / ⁿ√b (quotient rule); 3) ᵐ√(ⁿ√a) = ^{mn}√a (nested radicals); 4) Simplify by factoring out perfect nth powers: √50 = √(25·2) = 5√2. Rationalizing denominator: multiply by conjugate or appropriate power: 1/√2 = √2/2; 1/(√3-1) = (√3+1)/2. Combining like radicals: 2√3 + 5√3 = 7√3, but √2 + √3 can't combine. Converting to rational exponents often simplifies operations: (√x)³ = x^{3/2}. Restrictions: even roots require non-negative radicands in real numbers; ⁿ√a is positive principal root. Solving radical equations: isolate radical, raise both sides to power n, check for extraneous solutions."
2026-01-13,Calculus,Hard,Analyze,Optimization with Constraints: How do Lagrange multipliers work?,61,"Lagrange multipliers solve constrained optimization: maximize/minimize f(x,y,z) subject to g(x,y,z) = k. Method: at constrained extremum, ∇f = λ∇g (gradient of f is parallel to gradient of g, where λ is Lagrange multiplier). Setup: 1) Define Lagrangian L(x,y,z,λ) = f(x,y,z) - λ(g(x,y,z) - k); 2) Solve system ∇L = 0: ∂L/∂x = 0, ∂L/∂y = 0, ∂L/∂z = 0, ∂L/∂λ = 0 (which gives constraint); 3) Solve system for critical points; 4) Evaluate f at all critical points and boundary to find max/min. Intuition: at extremum, moving along constraint surface shouldn't increase/decrease f, so level curves of f and g must be tangent (parallel gradients). Multiple constraints g₁ = k₁, g₂ = k₂: use L = f - λ₁(g₁ - k₁) - λ₂(g₂ - k₂), solve ∇f = λ₁∇g₁ + λ₂∇g₂. Example: maximize xy subject to x + y = 10 → ∇(xy) = λ∇(x+y) → (y,x) = λ(1,1) → y = λ, x = λ, x+y=10 → x=y=5, max=25."
2026-01-12,Functions,Medium,Understand,"Piecewise Functions: How do you define, graph, and evaluate piecewise functions?",73,"Piecewise function: defined by different formulas on different intervals. Notation: f(x) = { f₁(x) if x ∈ I₁, f₂(x) if x ∈ I₂, ... }. Example: f(x) = { x² if x < 0, 2x if x ≥ 0 }. Evaluation: identify which interval x belongs to, use corresponding formula. Example: f(-2) = (-2)² = 4, f(3) = 2(3) = 6. Graphing: 1) Graph each piece on its domain; 2) Use open circle for excluded endpoints, closed circle for included; 3) Check continuity at boundaries. Domain: union of all intervals. Range: union of ranges of each piece. Continuity at x = a: requires lim_{x→a⁻} f(x) = lim_{x→a⁺} f(x) = f(a). Common piecewise functions: absolute value |x| = { -x if x<0, x if x≥0 }; step functions (floor ⌊x⌋, ceiling ⌈x⌉); tax brackets; shipping costs. Differentiability: check if left and right derivatives match at boundaries. Applications: modeling real-world scenarios with different rules in different conditions."
